    """Generic command class. An LLM can perform tasks by invoking commands to gain agency

    Command loops
    ----------
    Every type of task is associated with a command that the Agent can issue.
    Each command has a name, a short sentence that indicates the purpose for using it, and content data

    In the methods, the one sentence summary will be available in `self.summary` and the input to the command 
    as `self.content`

    Each turn the AI can issue any number of commands.  If any one of generates output to human user, then 
    control will be surrendered and all generated output will be given to the outter driving program.  The
    next turn, the AI will receive all of the prompt responses generated by each of the commands it issued in 
    the last turn, as well as any human input if requested.

    Overseer, Messenger and QA
    ----------
    These provide various different ways to interact and control the tasks that the Agent creates through 
    commands to gain more imformation, ensure quality of the response, and perhaps most importantly, 
    ensure the supremacy of humankind.

        Overseer:
        Every command that the Agent issues is first given to the Overseer before a task can be created from a command.
    If the overseer returns anything, the command is rejected and the instruction is directly returned to the Agent. 
    Algorithms intended to detect attempts for taking over the world should be placed here.  If it is really bad raise
    and Exception ASAP.  It is probably not a good idea to have the same model create the command and also monitor it. 
    The default Overseer is very lazy and simply prints the command and purpose out and grants any requests. 

        Messenger:
        A callback function that is passed to every instance of tasks created from commands so that it can relay 
    information to external driving systems as it runs.  It will pass the following information out:
        - `command`: name of the command
        - `task`:    reference to the task instance
        - `data`:    any data that needs to be passed back to system
    In the task, call `self.send_message(**data)` to send data through the messenger automatically.
    You can use it to do logging, implement progress bar etc, mostly things that you need in the client side for the chat app.
    PYTHON command for example, uses messenger to notify about packages that are requested to be installed, and report 
    files that are created.

        QA:
        Whenever a response is sent to human, QA is invoked with the original question asked and the agent's answer. 
    For example, the agent may be lazy and keep trying to say it cannot do its work, and the QA can just tell it to try harder 
    when that happens.  Or it can check and see if the answer is correctly addressed.  If QA rejects the answer, the user will 
    not see the response and the return of QA is sent back to the agent as instructions.

    Developing new commands
    ----------
    Developers will inherit this class to define new abilities for the chatbot.  This is very similar 
    to OpenAI Plug-Ins.  When one subclasses `BaseCommand` the task will be automatically registered and 
    become available to the agent.
    
    See the `__init_subclass__` method for a list of parameters to be passed when creating the subclass.  

    Each registered subclass will automatically generate the following text that will be injected into the 
    in a manner not visible to the human user.
    - Command description: Teach the AI the command and a short sentence describing how and why it should be used.
        This will be shown to the AI agent during system prompt or when it did issue any valid commands.
    - Additional contenxt: This will be shown to the AI agent in the system prompt only.  Use this to provide more 
        complex instructions and examples.  

    Our philosophy is to keep the command as simple as possible and use natural language whenever possible, and 
    use separate sessions to convert those natural language to structured data if needed.  This is because the 
    difficult and long description and example needed for the agent to master complex syntaxes will cause difficulties.

    The developer can also choose to override zero, one or both of these two methods
    - generate_response_to_human():  If this method returns anything, the driver will yield control to the outside 
            program and return the content in here.  Note that the user do not have to see the same thing as the 
            AI returns.  The human's response will then be given to the AI to drive the next action cycle

    - generate_prompt(): Alternatively the command might not involve any human interaction and this method can be 
            used to provide any instruction or data to the AI agent.

    Generally speaking most commands are enhancements under the hood that only implements `generate_prompt()`.
