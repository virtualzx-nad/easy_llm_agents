      "  - `answer`: Answer a question or report that a requested task has been successfully performed, when you are confident of the results.\n",

      " - `read_page`: Obtain info from a page based on URL. Describe what to extract with the description field. If you need original text, explicitly say verbatim in the description; otherwise returns will be summarized. \n",
      " - `python`: Submit Python code that perform complex tasks or computations. Printouts or error messages will be returned to you. The content must be a Python dictionary with fields:\n",

      "    - request_file: Optional. Request files to be supplied; \n",

      "    - packages: Optional. A list of packages that need to be installed\n",
      "    - execute: Optional.  If False, the code will be saved but not executed. Default is True.\n",
