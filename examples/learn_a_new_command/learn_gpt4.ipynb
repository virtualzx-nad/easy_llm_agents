The code block shows the implementation of the command using the BaseCommand class and defining the command name, description, and required parameters. When implementing a command, the command instance will have access to self.metadata, self.summary, and self.content. Custom hooks are implemented to provide convenient ways to monitor, control, and interact with tasks created by the agent through commands. A metadata dictionary is attached to every conversation and made available to all task instances. A callback function, passed to task instances, relays information to external driving systems in real-time. When a response is sent to a human, QA is invoked with the original question and the agent's answer. QA can reject the answer and provide suggestions to the agent on how to improve. The Overseer is responsible for approving or rejecting commands before a task can be created from a command. The default Overseer grants any requests and simply prints the command and purpose. It is recommended not to use the default Overseer if you have extremely powerful models or commands. Two implementations of QA are provided, one simply passes every response, the other uses GPT to inspect the question and answer and give evaluations and suggestions accordingly. The text also lists built-in commands that are included by default, such as answer, search, reader, and writer.\\n\"}\n",
