Sure, here is an example of a python file that retrieves the weather forecast for a specific date in the near future, with the date variable set to '2023-02-21':

```python
import requests

def weather_forecast(date):
    # search weather forecast for date
    search = requests.get("https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+forecast+{}&tbs=news&tbm=auto", date)
    search_response = search.json()
    # extract temperature and date
    temp = search_response['results'][0]['temperature']
    date = search_response['results'][0]['date']
    return "The weather forecast for {} is {}.".format(date, temp)

# example usage
date = "2023-02-21"
forecast = weather_forecast(date)
print(forecast)
```

This code uses the `requests` module to send a GET request to Google and search for the weather forecast for the given date. The returned JSON data is then parsed to extract the temperature and date, which are then returned as a string.

This is just an example, and you can customize the code to fit your specific needs.
