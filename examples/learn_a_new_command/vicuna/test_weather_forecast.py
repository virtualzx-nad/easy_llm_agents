Sure, here's an example Python file that tests the `weather_forecast` function from the `weather_forecast.py` file:
```python
import unittest
from mock import patch
from weather_forecast import weather_forecast

class TestWeatherForecast(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('requests.get')
    def test_forecast_for_date(self, mock_get):
        mock_response = mock.Mock(return_value={'results': [{'temperature': '72', 'date': 'Fri, 21 Feb 2023'},]})
        mock_get.return_value = mock_response

        date = '2023-02-21'
        forecast = weather_forecast(date)
        
        self.assertEqual(forecast, 'The weather forecast for 2023-02-21 is 72.')
        
    @patch('requests.get')
    def test_invalid_date(self, mock_get):
        mock_response = mock.Mock(return_value={'results': [{'temperature': '72', 'date': 'Fri, 21 Feb 2023'},]})
        mock_get.return_value = mock_response

        date = '2023-02-30'
        forecast = weather_forecast(date)
        
        self.assertEqual(forecast, 'The weather forecast for 2023-02-30 could not be found.')
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
In this example, we use the `unittest` module to create a test case for the `weather_forecast` function. We use the `mock` library to patch the `requests.get` method so that we can test the function with a mock response.

We have two test cases: one that tests the function with a valid date, and one that tests the function with an invalid date. In the first test case, we create a mock response that returns a temperature of 72 degrees and a date of February 21, 2023. We then call the `weather_forecast` function with the `date` variable set to '2023-02-21'. We then assert that the returned forecast is equal to the string 'The weather forecast for 2023-02-21 is 72.'.

In the second test case, we create a mock response with the same temperature and date as before, but set the `date` variable to '2023-02-30'. We then call the `weather_forecast` function with the `date` variable set to '2023-02-30'. We then assert that the returned forecast is equal to the string 'The weather forecast for 2023-02-30 could not be found.'.

This test case will ensure that the `weather_forecast` function works as expected and returns the correct forecast for valid and invalid dates.
