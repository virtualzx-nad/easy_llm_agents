Do not read a file if it only needs to be passed to a worker; pass the filename directly.\n",

You need to provide sufficient context for workers, and repeat any relevant information mentioned or returned in previous commands.  Do not create separate steps to Each worker should save their own files.\n",

You can write any non-binary files, for example a user manual, a book, an email, a README.md file, a javascript or Python source file, etc. Please provide sufficient context so that the writer can properly write the file correctly. Must provide these fields in context: `filename` name of the file to write including suffix which determines the file format; `instruction` string describing precisely what to write in the file; `context` string to provide detailed context for the writer to correctly write the file; `context_file` list all files that contain relevant context. Always try to write one file at a time to provide more precise instructions and context.\n",
