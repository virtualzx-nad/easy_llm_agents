WeatherAPI.com provides a free weather API and Geolocation API (JSON and XML) for hourly, daily and 15 min interval weather, historical data. The API provides access to real-time weather, 14-day weather forecast, historical weather, marine weather and tide data, future weather (up to 300 days ahead), daily and hourly intervals, 15 min interval (Enterprise only), astronomy, time zone, sports, location data, search or autocomplete API, weather alerts, air quality data and bulk request.

Developers need to sign up and find their API key under their account to use the API. The API access to the data is protected by an API key. The API can be accessed by making HTTP or HTTPS request to the base URL: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1.

The following API methods are available:
- /current.json or /current.xml for current weather
- /forecast.json or /forecast.xml for forecast
- /search.json or /search.xml for search or autocomplete
- /history.json or /history.xml for history
- /marine.json or /marine.xml for marine
- /future.json or /future.xml for future
- /timezone.json or /timezone.xml for time zone
- /sports.json or /sports.xml for sports
- /astronomy.json or /astronomy.xml for astronomy

For Forecast and History API method, the following parameters are available:
- bulk: Number of days of forecast required. Required only with forecast API method. days parameter value ranges between 1 and 14. e.g: days=5. If no days parameter is provided then only today's weather is returned.

For history API 'dt' should be on or after 1st Jan, 2010 in yyyy-MM-dd format (i.e. dt=2010-01-01). For forecast API 'dt' should be between today and next 14 day in yyyy-MM-dd format (i.e. dt=2010-01-01). For future API 'dt' should be between 14 days and 300 days from today in the future in yyyy-MM-dd format (i.e. dt=2023-01-01).
