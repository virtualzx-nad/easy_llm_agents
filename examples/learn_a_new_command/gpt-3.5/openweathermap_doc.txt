The One Call API provides weather data for any geographical coordinate. It offers current weather, minute forecast for 1 hour, hourly forecast for 48 hours, daily forecast for 7 days, national weather alerts, and historical weather data for the previous 5 days. To make an API call, users need to provide the geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude) and their unique API key. Users can also exclude some parts of the weather data from the API response by using the "exclude" parameter and choose the units of measurement with the "units" parameter. The API response can be returned in different languages using the "lang" parameter.

Fields in API response:

- lat: Geographical coordinates of the location (latitude)
- lon: Geographical coordinates of the location (longitude)
- timezone: Timezone name for the requested location
- timezone_offset: Shift in seconds from UTC

Current weather data API response:
