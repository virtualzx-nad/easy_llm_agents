WeatherAPI.com provides free weather data and forecast API suitable for any cartographic services. The API provides real-time weather, 14 day weather forecast, historical weather, marine weather and tide data, future weather (up to 300 days ahead), daily and hourly intervals, 15 min interval (Enterprise only), astronomy, time zone, sports, location data, search or autocomplete API, weather alerts, air quality data, and bulk request.

To use the API, users need to sign up and find their API key under their account. API access to the data is protected by an API key. The API can be accessed by making HTTP or HTTPS request to the base URL: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1. The API provides various APIs such as current weather, forecast, search or autocomplete, history, marine, future, time zone, sports, astronomy, and IP lookup.

For the forecast API method, the `days` parameter is required and should be a number between 1 and 14. If no `days` parameter is provided then only today's weather is returned.

For the History and Future API methods, the `dt` parameter is required and should be in yyyy-MM-dd format. For the History API method, `dt` should be on or after 1st Jan, 2010. For the Forecast API method, `dt` should be between today and next 14 days. For the Future API method, `dt` should be between 14 days and 300 days from today in the future.

The `unixdt` parameter is optional and has the same restrictions as the `dt` parameter. The `end_dt` parameter is available for the History API method and should be on or after 1st Jan, 2010. The `unixend_dt` parameter has the same restrictions as the `end_dt` parameter.

The `hour`, `alerts`, `aqi`, `tides`, `tp`, and `lang` parameters are optional. The `lang` parameter should be passed with a language code from the table provided in the text.

The Location Object is returned with each API response and provides information about the location including geo points, name, region, country and time zone information.

The Forecast API method returns alerts and warnings issued by government agencies (USA, UK, Europe and Rest of the World) as an array if available for the location provided. To get alerts back in the response from Forecast API, pass the parameter `alerts=yes`.

Air Quality data is returned in the Forecast API and Realtime API response. Depending upon your subscription plan we provide current and 3 day air quality data for the given location in json and xml. It provides air quality index (see below) data on major pollutant gases like Carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), PM 2.5 and PM 10. By default air quality data is not returned. To get air quality data back in the response from Forecast API and Realtime API, pass the parameter aqi=yes.

Bulk Request

If you are on Pro+, Business or Enterprise plan then you may use our bulk weather option to send multiple locations to get weather for all the locations sent in a single request.

Each location sent in bulk operation is counted as 1 call. It works for all the API methods except Search API.

For bulk you need to pass in the querysting q=bulk and then pass a json body with utf-8 encoding. All the the other request parameters will be passed as query as usual.

Json format for sending multiple locations in the body.

    "locations": [
        {
            "q": "53,-0.12",
            "custom_id": "my-id-1"
        },
        {
            "q": "London",
            "custom_id": "any-internal-id"
