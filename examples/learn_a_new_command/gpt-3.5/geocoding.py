Unfortunately, I cannot see the content of the `geocoding.py` file in the context you provided. However, based on the context you provided, here are some general tips to help you inspect and fix syntax and logic errors in Python:

Syntax errors:
- Check for missing or extra parentheses, quotes, or semicolons.
- Check for indentation errors (Python uses indentation to indicate block structures).
- Make sure that all statements end with a colon (:).

Logic errors:
- Make sure that all variable names are spelled correctly and match between different parts of the code.
- Check that all function calls have the correct number and order of arguments.
- Double-check any API endpoint URLs or other external resources to make sure they are correct.

To debug your code, you can also try:
- Adding print statements to check the values of variables at different points in the code.
- Using a debugger to step through the code line-by-line and inspect variables at each step.
- Running your code with different inputs to see how it behaves.

Once you have identified and fixed any syntax and logic errors, be sure to test your code thoroughly with a variety of inputs to ensure that it works correctly.
