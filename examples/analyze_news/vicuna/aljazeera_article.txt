The United Nations has warned of a mass exodus of over 800,000 people from Sudan as fighting between government forces and rebels continues to rage on, causing a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on May 1 that the number of people displaced by the conflict has reached 400,000, with many living in dire conditions without access to food, water, and healthcare. The fighting, which started on April 10, has also led to a severe shortage of medical supplies and health workers, putting thousands of pregnant women and children at risk of dying from preventable causes. Abdou, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said that the situation in Sudan is "very dire" and that the fighting is "turning a bad situation into a catastrophe." The conflict in Sudan started when security forces attempted to disperse a sit-in protest organized by the opposition, which had been calling for the military to hand over power to a civilian government. The government has since launched a crackdown on the opposition, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people and the arrest of many more. The African Union has called for an independent investigation into the violence, while the US has imposed sanctions on Sudan's ruling military council. The UN has also expressed concern about the use of live ammunition against protesters and the blocking of humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. The situation in Sudan remains volatile, with no clear end to the conflict in sight.
