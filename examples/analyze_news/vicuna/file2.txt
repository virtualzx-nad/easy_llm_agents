Here is a code that you can use to write the contents of file2.txt to the console:
```python
# The contents of file2.txt
with open("file2.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
```
To run this code, save it in a file with a .py extension (e.g. file2.py) and run it with the Python interpreter. The output will be:
```
The contents of file2.txt
```
This is because the code reads the contents of file2.txt and prints it to the console.
