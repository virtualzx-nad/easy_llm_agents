       "\"The conflict in Sudan involves clashes between Sudan's military and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands fleeing. The power struggle is between Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti). Civilians demand military oversight and RSF integration. The fighting began on April 15, and there is a humanitarian crisis with people trapped in their homes and tens of thousands fleeing to Chad and South Sudan. A 72-hour ceasefire has been agreed upon, but tensions remain high during negotiations to integrate RSF into the military. Geopolitical dimensions involve Russia, US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others, with Russia's mercenary group, Wagner, boosting RSF's missile supplies. The UN Security Council is holding a meeting on the crisis, and Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate.\\n\""
