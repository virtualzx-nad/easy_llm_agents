      " - `read_page`: Obtain info from a page based on URL. Describe what to extract with the description field. If you need original text, explicitly say verbatim in the description; otherwise returns will be summarized. Use this tool instead of directly scrape with Python code.  If one reading did not give you the desired content, try to change your instructions.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Significant Developments in 2022\n",
      "\n",
      "The year 2022 has seen significant growth in foundation models, which are AI models trained on a massive scale[^1^]. The pace has only accelerated this year and moved firmly into the mainstream, thanks to the jaw-dropping text-to-image possibilities of DALL-E 2, Google's Imagen and Midjourney, as well as the options for computer vision applications from Microsoft's Florence and the multimodal options from Deep Mind's Gato[^1^]. Foundation models like DALL-E and GPT-3 offer new creative opportunities as well as new ways to interact with systems[^1^]. These systems may lower the barrier for entry and enable a far larger class of people[^1^]. Going forward, the cost of foundation models, and the energy used, will go down dramatically, thanks in part to hardware and software specifically targeted towards training them by leveraging the technology more effectively[^1^].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Unforeseen Abilities\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI's GPT-4 has exhibited significantly improved abilities across many dimensions, including summarizing lengthy documents, answering complex questions, and even writing code and poetry[^2^]. There have also been significant advancements in image generation, with models like DALL-E 2 and Imagen producing high-quality images[^2^]. Another frontier for generative models has been code, with models able to generate code based on text prompts and even explain or debug code[^2^]. Technical innovations such as the transformer architecture, scale, and in-context learning have led to these advancements[^2^]. In-context learning allows models to perform new tasks without additional training by prompting them with instructions or descriptions of the task[^2^].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Advancements in Perception Tasks\n",
      "\n",
      "The ChatGPT model, which has significantly improved capabilities compared to previous models in the GPT family, is optimized for dialogue and is much better at following instructions[^2^]. The model was trained using a self-supervised pre-training approach, where models are trained on unsupervised language data using an autoregressive next word prediction approach[^2^]. The pace of innovation and acceleration of advances in generative AI have been challenging traditional benchmarking methods[^2^]. Many benchmarks are becoming obsolete soon after they are released due to the fast progress being made[^2^]. The article also discusses the potential of large language models integrated with search and other tools, which can add much value to many scenarios[^2^]. However, there are also challenges and limitations that need to be addressed, such as reliability, safety, accuracy, trust, provenance, bias, user experience, personalization, and evaluation[^2^].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "Foundation models can help businesses generate content, such as product descriptions or marketing copy[^3^]. Multi-modal foundation models could help businesses—particularly design-focussed businesses—generate rough drafts of visual ideas[^3^]. Bing + ChatGPT is an example of an exciting business application of foundation models[^3^].

    "print(\"\\n# Recent Developments\\n\\n## Significant Developments in 2022\\n\\nThe year 2022 has seen significant growth in foundation models, which are AI models trained on a massive scale[^1^]. The pace has only accelerated this year and moved firmly into the mainstream, thanks to the jaw-dropping text-to-image possibilities of DALL-E 2, Google's Imagen and Midjourney, as well as the options for computer vision applications from Microsoft's Florence and the multimodal options from Deep Mind's Gato[^1^]. Foundation models like DALL-E and GPT-3 offer new creative opportunities as well as new ways to interact with systems[^1^]. These systems may lower the barrier for entry and enable a far larger class of people[^1^]. Going forward, the cost of foundation models, and the energy used, will go down dramatically, thanks in part to hardware and software specifically targeted towards training them by leveraging the technology more effectively[^1^].\\n\\n## Unforeseen Abilities\\n\\nOpenAI's GPT-4 has exhibited significantly improved abilities across many dimensions, including summarizing lengthy documents, answering complex questions, and even writing code and poetry[^2^]. There have also been significant advancements in image generation, with models like DALL-E 2 and Imagen producing high-quality images[^2^]. Another frontier for generative models has been code, with models able to generate code based on text prompts and even explain or debug code[^2^]. Technical innovations such as the transformer architecture, scale, and in-context learning have led to these advancements[^2^]. In-context learning allows models to perform new tasks without additional training by prompting them with instructions or descriptions of the task[^2^].\\n\\n## Advancements in Perception Tasks\\n\\nThe ChatGPT model, which has significantly improved capabilities compared to previous models in the GPT family, is optimized for dialogue and is much better at following instructions[^2^]. The model was trained using a self-supervised pre-training approach, where models are trained on unsupervised language data using an autoregressive next word prediction approach[^2^]. The pace of innovation and acceleration of advances in generative AI have been challenging traditional benchmarking methods[^2^]. Many benchmarks are becoming obsolete soon after they are released due to the fast progress being made[^2^]. The article also discusses the potential of large language models integrated with search and other tools, which can add much value to many scenarios[^2^]. However, there are also challenges and limitations that need to be addressed, such as reliability, safety, accuracy, trust, provenance, bias, user experience, personalization, and evaluation[^2^].\\n\\n## Applications\\n\\nFoundation models can help businesses generate content, such as product descriptions or marketing copy[^3^]. Multi-modal foundation models could help businesses—particularly design-focussed businesses—generate rough drafts of visual ideas[^3^]. Bing + ChatGPT is an example of an exciting business application of foundation models[^3^]. Netflix used artificial intelligence to assist with the creation of background images in an animated short film called “Dog and Boy”[^3^].\\n\\n[^1^]: [Foundation models: 2022's AI paradigm shift](https://venturebeat.com/ai/foundation-models-2022s-ai-paradigm-shift/)\\n[^2^]: [AI Explainer: Foundation models \\u200band the next era of AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/ai-explainer-foundation-models-and-the-next-era-of-ai/)\\n[^3^]: [Foundation models: a guide](https://snorkel.ai/foundation-models/)\\n\")"

Each dict correspond to a command with the following fields\\n        - command:  name of the command\\n        - summary:  one sentence summary of the purpose of invoking the command\\n        - content:  content that is passed to the worker, usually a list.  Each command should define what need to be provided in the content.\\n    Information requested will be returned in next prompt.  If a command does not produce the expected effect, take a note to yourself about why do you think that happened, and make sure you try a different approach instead of keep repeating a failed one.\\n    Do not add any explanations outside of the list, do not enclose it in quotation, and speak to the user only through commands.\\n    The full list of valid commands are:\\n - `answer`: Answer a question or report that a requested task has been successfully performed, when you are confident of the results.\\n - `self_note`: Note to yourself to plan your action and break difficult tasks into managable steps. Notes are invisible to others. Try to plan how to perform difficult tasks and obtain information with your commands instead of asking the user. \\n - `search`: Search Goole to get top results and URLs. Try your best to construct the most effective query based on your knowledge and choose a sensible result count limit.\\n - `read_page`: Obtain info from a page based on URL. Describe what to extract with the description field. If you need original text, explicitly say verbatim in the description; otherwise returns will be summarized. Use this tool instead of directly scrape with Python code.  If one reading did not give you the desired content, try to change your instructions.\\n - `python`: Submit Python code that perform complex tasks or computations. Printouts or error messages will be returned to you. You should not use this for the sole purpose of creating files. The content must be a Python dictionary with fields:\\n    - code: Required field.  A string containing the code snippet\\n    - request_file: Optional. Request files to be supplied; \\n    - save_as:  Optional. String. Filename for the code to be saved as; do not include path.\\n    - return_variables:  Optional. List of variable names that you need to be returned after the code is executed\\n    - reuse_variables: Optional. list of variable returned in previous sessions that you want to reuse\\n    - packages: Optional. A list of packages that need to be installed\\n    - execute: Optional.  If False, the code will be saved but not executed. Default is True.\\n    - note: any important messages. If you are unable to directly execute, put a message in `note`, code that you cannot execute in the `code` field, and do not return an `execute` field.\\n\\n - `delegate`: Delegate each task to a worker if you have 3 or more tasks. This is necessary because you have a token limit which make it impossible to perform tasks that involve too many steps.  Any tasks that do not need long contexts and require multiple steps should be delegated. You must divide tasks into smaller ones before you delegate them.  Provide the following fields in content:\\n     - `instruction`: instruction for the worker. The worker will only see your problem description, but not any previous conversations.\\n     - `context':  any context information that the worker need to know to fulfill the instruction.  You must explicitly specify any artifacts such as URL, filenames, resource names that are involved or as output.\\n\\n - `save_file`: Save or append text to a file; if you need multiple save_file commands you should delegate instead. Provide the following fields in content: `filename` name of the file; `text`: text to be saved; `append`: Optional, append to the end of file instead of creating a new one (default False).\\nFull list of valid commands: ['answer', 'self_note', 'search', 'read_page', 'python', 'delegate', 'save_file']\\n\"}]"
