Turing Award for his invention of Ethernet. The third command was to find the location of Bob Metcalfe's Turing award medal, but it also returned no results.

The `search` command returns three URLs related to Bob Metcalfe's Turing award. The first URL is from The New York Times, which reports that Bob Metcalfe helped develop the primary technology that lets you send email or connect with a printer over an office network. The second URL is from MIT News, which reports that Robert Metcalfe has been awarded the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) A.M. Turing Award. The third URL is from Harvard University, which reports that technology developed 50 years ago remains the dominant way of connecting computers and billions of other devices to each other and the...
