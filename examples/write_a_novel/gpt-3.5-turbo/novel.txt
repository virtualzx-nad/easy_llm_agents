I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to specific novels or their texts. However, if you have the text file of the novel, you can open it in any text editor and save it in a readable format such as .txt, .doc, or .pdf. Alternatively, you can search for the novel online and purchase a digital copy that will be in a readable format.
