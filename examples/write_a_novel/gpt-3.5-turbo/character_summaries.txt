I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot create files on your computer. However, you can create a new file on your preferred text editor or word processing software and use the following template to record each character's summary:

Character Name: 

Physical Appearance: 

Personality Traits: 

Backstory: 

Motivations: 

Character Development: 

Here's an example of how you can fill in the template for one of the characters:

Character Name: John Smith

Physical Appearance: John is a tall man with broad shoulders and a lean build. He has short brown hair and blue eyes. He wears glasses and has a neatly trimmed beard.

Personality Traits: John is a hard worker and is very dedicated to his job. He is also very intelligent and curious. He enjoys problem-solving and is always looking for ways to improve processes and systems.

Backstory: John was born and raised in a small town in the Midwest. His parents were farmers and he grew up helping them on the farm. He was always interested in science and technology, but didn't have many opportunities to explore his interests until he went to college.

Motivations: John's main motivation is to be successful in his career and make a positive impact on the world through technology.

Character Development: Throughout the novel, John will learn to balance his work and personal life and develop stronger relationships with his loved ones.

Repeat this format for each character in the novel, and save the document as "character_summaries.txt" or any name you prefer.
