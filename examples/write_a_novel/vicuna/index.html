I'm sorry, but I cannot save the Yadaa frontend code in index.html for you as I am a text-based AI language model. I can only provide you with instructions on how to save the code in index.html.

To save the Yadaa frontend code in index.html, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor.
2. Locate the `<body>` tag in the file.
3. Copy and paste the frontend code that I provided earlier between the `<body>` tag and the `</body>` tag in `index.html`.
4. Save the changes to the `index.html` file.

After you have saved the changes, the frontend code should be visible in the `index.html` file.
