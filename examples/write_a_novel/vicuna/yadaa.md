I'm sorry, but I cannot save the Yadaa README.md file in yadaa.md as I am a text-based AI language model and do not have the ability to save files. However, you can copy and paste the content of the Yadaa README.md file into a new file named yadaa.md in your preferred text editor or file management system.
