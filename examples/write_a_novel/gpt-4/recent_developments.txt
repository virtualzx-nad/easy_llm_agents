1. Researchers have developed a highly performing device for polariton-based coherent microwave emission and amplification. Polaritons are unique quasi-particles that are half light and half matter, produced when light strongly interacts with matter.

2. Scientists have created new hybrid photocatalysts for water splitting with an internal quantum efficiency above 100%. These scalable methods to reliably split water into hydrogen and oxygen could have valuable implications for the energy industry.

3. A study found that female astronauts are more efficient, suggesting future space missions with all-female crews.

4. More evidence has been found showing the moon's inner core is solid, like Earth's.

5. Fruit fly gut research has led to the discovery of a new phosphate-storing organelle.

6. Researchers have created atomically thin artificial neurons capable of processing both light and electric signals for computing. The material enables the simultaneous existence of separate feedforward and feedback paths within the neurons.
