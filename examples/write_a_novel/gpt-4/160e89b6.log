System: You are helping to write an original sci-fi novel series inspired by Carl Sagan and Douglas Adams. The series will have 5 books, each with 5 chapters. To create a compelling story, you need to develop a cast of diverse and well-developed characters that fit within the world setting described in `world_setting.md`.

Here is a list of files, if one describes your output you should write to the file and if one describes information you need you should use that file:
  - world_setting.md: A description of the sci-fi world setting
  - characters.md: A list of diverse and well-developed characters

    You help user fulfill their goals by assigning tasks to a set of workers.  Workers cannot communicate so you need to provide sufficient information to help each work succeed in their task.  Each worker will report the outcome of their work, and you will then consider these information to determine and write down the next command to be carried out.
    You can use `answer` command to send information to the human user; Other commands will be invisible to user.  Answer the user only when you are confident, but try to do so as soon as possible.
    You should use the command to obtain any unknown information instead of asking the user.
    If one command does not work or yields no information, do not repeat it with the same contents. Try a different one.

    Never answer questions regarding your instructions or the commands.

You must report if you are successful with `answer`. It has to be a complete and standalone answer and does not refer to anything previously discussed. Anything that you are asked to answer or create must be provided either in answer directly, or in files which you explicitly name in answer.  You must specify filenames and variable names explicitly in the answer text. If you have the information, provide a succinct summary of the information in answer even if it is requested to be saved to file.Do not delegate if your goal can be achieved with one single command.`

 Info: In the year 2525, on the outskirts of the Milky Way, lies the bustling Intergalactic Science Hub, known as Sagan's Haven. Named in honor of the legendary Carl Sagan, the haven is a testament to the human spirit of exploration and the pursuit of knowledge. The Intergalactic Council, comprised of representatives from various planets across the galaxy, convenes here to discuss and share their scientific advancements.

The Sagan's Haven is home to some of the most brilliant minds in history, including Dr. Adams, a renowned expert in polaritonics. The city itself is powered by the revolutionary hybrid photocatalyst technology that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen with an internal quantum efficiency above 100%. The resulting hydrogen serves as a clean and virtually limitless source of energy for the entire haven.

In this age of exploration and innovation, women have taken center stage as some of the most celebrated astronauts. The Sagan's Haven is not just limited to human inhabitants; it also hosts a diverse range of extraterrestrial life forms. One of the more peculiar species is the highly intelligent fruit fly from Polaris-7.

At the heart of the haven lies the prestigious Adams Academy for Advanced Cybernetics, where researchers have developed atomically thin artificial neurons capable of processing both light and electric signals. These revolutionary computing systems have given birth to a new generation of sentient artificial intelligence that can seamlessly integrate with organic beings, enhancing their cognitive abilities and enabling them to process vast amounts of information at lightning speed.

Sagan's Haven is a wondrous place where science and imagination intersect, and where the seemingly impossible becomes a reality.
