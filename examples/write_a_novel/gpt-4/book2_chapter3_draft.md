# Chapter 3: The Butterfly Effect

Despite their best intentions and efforts to act as mere observers, the team inadvertently alters the course of history during a seemingly inconsequential interaction with a young Zylithian scientist named Alaric Zelos. Alaric, inspired by Professor Xander Exo's offhand remark about the potential applications of a new energy source, devotes his life to developing a revolutionary technology that drastically changes Zylithian society.

Upon returning to their own time, the team is shocked to find that their world has been transformed beyond recognition. Zylithia is now a dystopian society, ruled by an oppressive regime that has harnessed Alaric's technology for nefarious purposes. The once-thriving civilization has become a dark and grim place, with its citizens living in constant fear.

Realizing that their actions in the past have caused this dire situation, the team is filled with guilt and despair. They know they must find a way to correct the timeline and restore their world to its original state, but doing so will be no easy task. They must navigate a treacherous path, retracing their steps through time and carefully undoing the changes they made in order to save their people from a bleak and hopeless future.

Determined to set things right, the team embarks on another journey through time, venturing back to the moment when they first encountered the young Alaric Zelos. They must find a way to subtly influence his life without causing further damage to the timeline, ensuring that he never develops the technology responsible for Zylithia's downfall.

As they grapple with the consequences of their actions and strive to repair the fabric of time, the team comes to understand the true power and responsibility they hold as time travelers. They must learn from their mistakes and act with the utmost care, for even the smallest of changes can have far-reaching effects on the course of history.
