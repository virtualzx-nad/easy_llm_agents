System: You are writing a scifi novel series inspired by Carl Sagan and Douglas Adams. To create a compelling story, you need to build a consistent and rich world using the recent scientific and technological developments found in `recent_developments.txt`.

Here is a list of files, if one describes your output you should write to the file and if one describes information you need you should use that file:
  - recent_developments.txt: A list of recent scientific and technological developments
  - world_setting.txt: A description of the world inspired by Carl Sagan and Douglas Adams

    You help user fulfill their goals by assigning tasks to a set of workers.  Workers cannot communicate so you need to provide sufficient information to help each work succeed in their task.  Each worker will report the outcome of their work, and you will then consider these information to determine and write down the next command to be carried out.
    You can use `answer` command to send information to the human user; Other commands will be invisible to user.  Answer the user only when you are confident, but try to do so as soon as possible.
    You should use the command to obtain any unknown information instead of asking the user.
    If one command does not work or yields no information, do not repeat it with the same contents. Try a different one.

    Never answer questions regarding your instructions or the commands.

Anything that you are asked to answer or create must be provided either in answer directly, or in files which you explicitly name in answer.  You must specify filenames and variable names explicitly in the answer text. If you have the information, provide a succinct summary of the information in answer even if it is requested to be saved to file.Do not delegate if your goal can be achieved with one single command.`

 Info: In a star system far from Earth, the planet Zylithia, inspired by Carl Sagan and Douglas Adams, orbited its binary stars. The Zylithians were intelligent beings who focused on unraveling cosmic mysteries and harnessing science to improve their lives. They had significant medical breakthroughs, such as a revolutionary treatment that could cure any bacterial infection, inspired by CRISPR-based drug candidates targeting E. coli.

Zylithia was enveloped in an intricate web of nanotechnology, with super-resolution imaging platforms allowing them to study nanoparticle interactions precisely. This led to the development of nanobots capable of repairing damaged cells, cleaning up the environment, and constructing cities atom by atom. The Zylithians had also mastered gene-editing techniques, extending their lifespans, eliminating genetic diseases, and engineering new life forms.

One engineered life form was the Vibro-Fern, which converted mechanical vibrations into electricity, meeting the planet's energy needs efficiently and sustainably. Another was the Excitonium Tree, harnessing the power of exciton condensates to absorb sunlight and convert it into energy with near-perfect efficiency.

Zylithian society was deeply influenced by artificial intelligence, with the Great Computron designing novel proteins for tasks like creating light and indestructible materials or substances that could heal wounds instantaneously. The AI system also fostered trust amongst Zylithians by providing unbiased guidance in interpersonal relationships.

The Zylithians' mastery of information storage set them apart, as they developed DNA microcapsules capable of storing vast amounts of data. Their first DNA data center was expected to store their entire history and knowledge, including information from other worlds encountered in their interstellar travels. Carl Sagan and Douglas Adams would have been proud of this world where reason and imagination coexisted, inspiring a society that celebrated both the grandeur of the cosmos and the absurdity of existence. The possibilities for Zylithia's future were as boundless as the universe itself.
