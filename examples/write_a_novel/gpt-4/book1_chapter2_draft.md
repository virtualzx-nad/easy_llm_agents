As news of the peculiar signal spreads throughout the scientific community, Captain Aria Nova is tasked with assembling an all-female crew to investigate the mysterious phenomenon. With her keen understanding of the unique challenges that lie ahead, she begins the selection process for her team.

First, she recruits Dr. Amelia Zephyr, the brilliant astrophysicist who discovered the signal. Captain Nova is impressed by Dr. Zephyr's determination and expertise, believing she will play a crucial role in deciphering the origins of the signal.

Next, Captain Nova seeks out Xan'arthra, a renowned biologist with extensive knowledge of extraterrestrial lifeforms. Her expertise in studying the intelligent fruit flies from Polaris-7 has earned her a reputation as one of the galaxy's leading experts on alien species. Captain Nova believes Xan'arthra's insight will be invaluable in understanding any potential lifeforms they may encounter during their mission.

Captain Nova then turns her attention to Lyra Starling, a gifted engineer with a specialization in polaritonics. Her groundbreaking work on interstellar communication systems has revolutionized long-distance communication across the galaxy. Captain Nova recruits Lyra to ensure that the crew will have access to the most advanced technologies during their journey.

Finally, Captain Nova recruits Anara, a skilled pilot and navigator with a deep knowledge of ancient galactic history. Her experience navigating uncharted territories and expertise in ancient artifacts make her the perfect candidate for guiding the crew through their expedition.

With her crew assembled, Captain Aria Nova prepares for their faster-than-light voyage to the distant star system. Together, they embark on a journey that promises to challenge their skills, test their courage, and uncover the secrets behind the mysterious signal.
