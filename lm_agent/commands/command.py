    Developing new commands
    ----------
    Developers will inherit this class to define new abilities for the chatbot.  This is very similar 
    to OpenAI Plug-Ins.  When one subclasses `Command` the task will be automatically registered and 
    become available to the agent.
    
    See the `__init_subclass__` method for a list of parameters to be passed when creating the subclass.  

    Each registered subclass will automatically generate the following text that will be injected into the 
    in a manner not visible to the human user.
    - Command description: Teach the AI the command and a short sentence describing how and why it should be used.
        This will be shown to the AI agent during system prompt or when it did issue any valid commands.
    - Additional contenxt: This will be shown to the AI agent in the system prompt only.  Use this to provide more 
        complex instructions and examples.  

    Our philosophy is to keep the command as simple as possible and use natural language whenever possible, and 
    use separate sessions to convert those natural language to structured data if needed.  This is because the 
    difficult and long description and example needed for the agent to master complex syntaxes will cause difficulties.

    The developer can also choose to override zero, one or both of these two methods
    - generate_response_to_human():  If this method returns anything, the driver will yield control to the outside 
            program and return the content in here.  Note that the user do not have to see the same thing as the 
            AI returns.  The human's response will then be given to the AI to drive the next action cycle

    - generate_prompt(): Alternatively the command might not involve any human interaction and this method can be 
            used to provide any instruction or data to the AI agent.

    Generally speaking most commands are enhancements under the hood that only implements `generate_prompt()`.

    You help user fulfill their goals by assigning tasks to a set of workers.  Workers cannot communicate so you need to provide sufficient information to help each work succeed in their task.  Each worker will report the outcome of their work, and you will then consider these information to determine and write down the next command to be carried out.
    You can use `answer` command to send information to the human user; Other commands will be invisible to user.  Answer the user only when you are confident, but try to do so as soon as possible.
    You should use the command to obtain any unknown information instead of asking the user.
    If one command does not work or yields no information, do not repeat it with the same contents. Try a different one.
